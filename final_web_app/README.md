Final Project for CS50

The Inequality Plot is a web app that visualizes the rise of income inequality in every state in America from 1917 to 2015.
The idea for the project was inspired by the book "Good Jobs, Bad Jobs" by Arne L. Kalleberg. The book centers on the growth of inequality in the United States, and contextualizes the changes as a result of, in part, stagnating wage growth for middle and working-class Americans
and a larger proportion of income going to those within the wealthiest strata of society.

I wanted to create a web-based interactive plot that can easily compare the levels of income inequality between different states through the Gini index.
Though depicting levels of inequality solely through the Gini metric is generally not satisfactory in fully representing income inequality in the United States,
it is sufficient for my purpose of showing the general trend of inequality.

Modules Utilized: Flask, Matplotlib, Mpld3, Werkzeug, SQLite3, Numpy, Pandas.
